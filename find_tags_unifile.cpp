  find_tags_unifile: Find sequences of pulses corresponding to bursts from
  tags registered in a database, but where frequency settings and pulses
  from all antennas are present in a single file.

  Optionally pre-filter pulse stream with a rate-limiting buffer.

  This version is greedy: a tag ID is emitted as soon as a full burst
  is recognized, and participating pulses are removed from
  consideration in other bursts.  An effort is made to identify runs
  of consecutive bursts from each tag, but well-timed noise can cause
  these to be split, even if all bursts are detected.

  This version accepts a continuous sequence of pulses from an
  antenna, together with an auxiliary file of time-stamped antenna
  frequency settings.  This avoids having to split raw pulse data into
  separate files by antenna frequency.  Also, we maintain a list of
  all tags at known frequencies, requiring only that IDs be unique
  within frequency.  When returning a tag hit, we supply tag ID and
  frequency.  Hits are only accepted when the range of frequency
  estimates of component pulses is within a command-line specified
  tolerance.

  We could simplify the code somewhat by this scheme:

  - merge tag databases across frequencies
  - assign a frequency to each pulse equal to antenna frequency + pulse 
    frequency offset
  - run the usual algorithm, without worrying about antenna frquency
  - the frequency slop filter would ensure we didn't assemble tag bursts
    from pulses at different nominal frequencies.

  However, merging the tag ID databases across frequencies might not
  be desirable, especially if the sets of IDs at different frequencies 
  have a large symmetric difference, as then our false positive
  rates (overall, not per tag ID) will go up.

  New simple greedy tag-extractor:

  First candidate accepting K consecutive pulses from a tag ID wins,
  and any other candidate locked on the same tag ID in the same 
  interval is killed off.

  Pulses are only accepted if the frequency difference isn't too big.

  A Tag_Candidate is in one of three quality levels:
  - MULTIPLE: more than one tag ID is compatible with pulses accepted so far
  - SINGLE: only one tag ID is compatible with pulses accepted so far
  - CONFIRMED: only one tag ID is compatible, and we've seen at least K consecutive pulses

  As soon as a candidate is confirmed, it kills off any TCs with
  the same ID or sharing any pulses.

   A tag emits a sequence of pulses of fixed length at a fixed VHF
   frequency.  The pulses are organized as bursts of PULSES_PER_BURST
   pulses.  For a tag with given ID, the spacing ("gaps") between
   pulses in a burst is fixed, and differs from that of tags with all
   other IDs.  The spacing ("burst interval") between consecutive
   bursts is also fixed for a tag, but can be the same as that of tags
   with other IDs.

   The (full-burst) tag recognition problem can be coded as an NDFA:

     Nodes:

       - a pair (Tag_ID_Set, phase).  This is the set of tag IDs
       compatible with the edges on the path from the root to this
       node.  Phase is the depth of the node in the tree (i.e. the
       number of edges traversed from root to this node).

       - the unique root has Tag_ID_Set = {all registered tag IDs} and
       phase = 0.

     Edges:

       - There is a directed edge labelled G from node (T1, p1) to node (T2, p2)
         iff:
               p2 = p1 + 1 (except for back edges and loops - see below)
           and T2 is a subset of T1
           and G is a valid gap at phase p1 for all tags in T2
       
	- edges represent recognition of a valid (for some subset of
          tags) gap between pulses

        - to allow for measurement error, there are multiple edges between any
	  two adjacent nodes, one for each G in some range [g - slop, g + slop],
	  down to some finite precision.

     Back Edges:

        -  to allow identification of consecutive hits from the same tag,
           the NDFA is augmented with back edges from the last pulse of
           two consecutive bursts to the start of the second burst.  Because
           tags are uniquely identified in a single burst, this allows the
           NDFA to keep recognizing the same tag when it sees bursts
           of the correct gap signature and interval spacing.

     Loops:

        -  to allow the NDFA to ignore a noise pulse, for each node N and each
           edge labelled G from N to a different node M != N, a loop edge 
           labelled G is added to N.  This edge corresponds to ignoring a noise
           pulse.
    
   Directed paths through the NDFA graph starting at root correspond
   to sequences of pulses generated by a single tag, starting at phase
   0, with no pulses missing, and with 0 or more intervening noise
   pulses.  Paths ending at a node in phase PULSES_PER_BURST - 1 have
   a unique edge-label sequence, since this is how tag IDs are encoded
   (i.e. the gaps between PULSES_PER_BURST pulses determine the tag).

   We use the usual subset construction to get a DFA corresponding to
   the NDFA without loop edges.  For loop edges, it seemed easier to
   clone the DFA whenever a pulse is added, with one copy accepting the
   pulse and the other not.

   A separate NDFA graph is built for each nominal VHF frequency in the
   tag database.

   Pulses are processed one at a time.  The current antenna frequency
   is used to selects which set of current tag candidates
   (i.e. running DFAs) is examined.  The pulse is added to each tag
   candidate with which it is compatible (given the time gap to the
   candidate's previous pulse, and the offset frequencies of candidate
   and pulse).  Usually, a DFA to which the pulse is added is also cloned
   before adding the pulse, i.e. the DFA is forked to allow for
   non-addition of the pulse, in case it is noise.  The exception is that
   we don't clone DFAs which already point to a single tag ID unless
   the new pulse is the first of a burst.  The reason to clone in this case
   is that we want to allow for large burst slop without derailing recognition
   of series of consecutive bursts from the same tag.  If we didn't clone,
   accepting a noise pulse within the large burst-slop window would soon kill
   the tag candidate (i.e. when no further pulses from the tag were seen).

   Tag_Candidate ages are compared to the time of the new pulse, and
   any which are too old are destroyed.  If a Tag_Candidate enters the
   CONFIRMED tag ID level, all bursts seen so far are output, and any
   other Tag_Candidates sharing any pulses or having the same unique
   tag ID are destroyed, so that every pulse is used for at most one
   recognized burst.  If a pulse does not cause any existing DFA to
   reach the CONFIRMED level, then a new DFA is started at that pulse.

   False Positive Rate

   Phil Taylor came up with this idea of how to estimate false positive
   rate:  keep track of the number of discarded detections of each tag ID,
   and report it at each dump of a confirmed hit.  Reset the count then.
   So actually, with each confirmed hit, we report the number of discarded
   hits per second since the last confirmed hit.
